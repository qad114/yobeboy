# yobeboy
A WIP Game Boy emulator for Linux (Windows and macOS are untested). Tetris is probably the only fully compatible game at the moment; however, MBC1 is implemented, and many games run with bugs/glitches.

## Building
Run `make` to build for Linux. Windows and macOS instructions will be added later.

## Usage
`./yobeboy <path to ROM>`
